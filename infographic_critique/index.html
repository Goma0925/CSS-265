      <h2>● A good example: The Missing Migrants Map</h2><br>
        <img src="The_Missing_Migrants_Map.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infographic was created to inform that the scale of migrants to Europe from other countries that had died or gone missing before they reach Europe.
          Each small dot represents a migrant trying to reach Europe. The red dot implies the migrant died and the black dot implies the migrant is missing. Each of the bigger grey dot represents an incident where migrants died or went missing. Some of the worst incidents are numbered and listed in the upper right and the middle, which enables us to search further about each incident and delve into the issue. The color of the map is set to very light grey so that the focus would be given to the important information. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This map successfully communicates the disperse and the scale of the incidents and the number of the victims in a visual form that enables us to take a glimpse of the issue. The color of the dots is effectively used to help us instantly distinguish those who are dead and missing . The information is organized in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and simplistic, eliminating excessive details.
          In addition to the successful data visualization, some of the background information is included, such as the victims’ gender ratio, countries of origin, and the routes of immigration. These pieces information provide the other aspects of the migration in Europe such as “North eastern African countries such as Tunisia seem to be a hub to Europe and the Italy is the entrance gate” and “migrants seemed to gather in the western Turkey”. This illustrates how the infographic expands the island of knowledge by providing a good amount of new information and providing the different aspects of the issue that would lead into further exploration. Also. the source of the information is also specified clearly on the website. It says that this infographic is based on the database of "The Missing Migrants Project" conducted by OM's Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC) and Media and Communications Division (MCD). To sum up, the infographic provides opportunities to explore the information and concisely communicate the important information with reliable information as what Cairo describes as a good data visualization.

      <h2>● A bad example: Child Poverty and School Performance</h2><br>
        <img src="child_poverty&school_performance.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This infographic was created to communicate the relation between the child poverty rate and school performance. However, it fails to organize the information in a meaningful way in which the relevant patterns become noticeable. It is difficult to grasp the way how the data is represented due to the way how the description of the colors is framed in the lower left corner. Although the two maps represent different data, the meaning of the color is explained in the same section. In addition, the divisions of both of the maps are poorly organized that they do not match with each other, which makes it challenging to compare them and derive a meaningful conclusions or insights. The labeling of the maps at the top is also very tiny in a way that confuses the viewer which map represents what data. In addition, the blunt contrast of the colors makes it difficult to intuitively understand the data, which makes the use of a visual map pointless. Finally, the source of the information is not well specified other than “Ofsted”, which is written at the top of the infographic. As a summary, this infographic lacks the essential components that Cairo suggests, clarity, reliable information, information visually encoded well to highlight important patterns, and the room for the exploration on the data.
